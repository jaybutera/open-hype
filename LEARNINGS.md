# Options Paper Trading — LEARNINGS

Persistent log across iterations of the `specs/options-paper.md` ralph loop. Append to this file every iteration. Read it first to avoid re-doing work or re-discovering gotchas.

## Design-phase findings (pre-iteration-1)

### Data source landscape (as of 2026-04-16)

- **Hyperliquid** has no native options. HIP-3 is perps only. HIP-4 (options-ish prediction markets) on testnet, mainnet expected Q2 2026.
- **Deribit** — crypto options only (BTC/ETH/SOL). Full CORS, no auth for market data. Reserved for future v2 crypto-options support.
- **Yahoo Finance** `/v7/finance/options/{SYMBOL}` — works, returns full chain with bid/ask/IV/volume/OI for any US equity or ETF. No Greeks (compute client-side). Huge coverage. Not an official API; needs cookie+crumb handshake.
- **Polygon free tier** — contracts list works, but snapshot/quote endpoints are locked behind paid tier. Free only gives EOD aggregates. Not enough for live paper trading.
- **Tradier sandbox** — free, Greeks included, CORS-enabled, browser-direct. User's application pending approval. If it comes through later, add a TradierAdapter behind the same interface.
- **Alpaca** — data endpoint blocks CORS, requires proxy. Not worth it.

Chose **Yahoo via a Vite dev-plugin proxy** for v1.

### Yahoo proxy — verified working (scratch at `/tmp/yahoo-proxy-test/`)

Real numbers from end-to-end test (browser → Vite → Yahoo):
```
TSLA  price $387.71  |  22 expirations  |  194 strikes
sample: TSLA260417C00005  bid 381.55  ask 382.80  IV 22.88
```

**Gotchas discovered:**

1. Node's default `fetch` (undici 16KB header limit) crashes on Yahoo's huge response headers. Must use `undici` with `new Agent({ maxHeaderSize: 128 * 1024 })`. Silent failure without this.
2. Vite's built-in `server.proxy` cannot do the multi-step cookie+crumb dance. Must use a `configureServer` middleware.
3. `Headers.get('set-cookie')` joins multiple cookies with commas and corrupts `Expires=...` dates. Use `headers.getSetCookie()` (array return).
4. `/v1/test/getcrumb` is aggressively IP-rate-limited. Cache the cookie+crumb for the process; refresh only on 401/403/429. Don't re-handshake per request.
5. User-Agent must be a real Chrome UA string. Generic or missing UA → 429 immediately.
6. Cookie + crumb stable for hours once acquired.
7. Yahoo is not an official API; ToS discourages scraping; fine for personal paper-trading but don't monetize.

### UX anchor — Robinhood Legend options chain

- Side-by-side layout (calls left / puts right / strike centered), NOT 4-column buy/sell grid
- Click **bid = sell**, click **ask = buy** — the cell encodes direction
- Up to 4 legs; each click appends a leg to the sticky order form
- Calendar/diagonal spreads supported (legs at different expirations)
- Net Greeks + simulated returns panel with time/IV sliders
- Gotchas to avoid: strategy-name loss on close, closed positions disappearing, no qty presets

### User preferences locked in

- Very broad symbol coverage (search box + free-form ticker entry + static popular list)
- 4-leg max is fine
- Compute Greeks client-side from IV (Black-Scholes)
- Shared paper account across perps and options
- Auto-exercise ITM at expiration, cash-settle, no early exercise, no share delivery
- Only operate during market hours
- Market-hours only — disable when closed
- Ralph agent picks one task per iteration, commits locally, branch `options-paper`, no push

## Iterations

<!-- Append iteration logs below this line -->

## Iteration: 2026-04-17 10:53

### Picked
Task 1 from iteration list: port the Yahoo proxy plugin from `/tmp/yahoo-proxy-test/vite.config.ts` into the main project. Highest priority because every downstream task (fixture capture, adapter, chain UI, paper trading) depends on having a working live chain source in the real dev server. Without this, nothing else can be built or tested end-to-end.

### Did
- `npm install undici` (added as direct dep; Node 22 ships it but the explicit `Agent` API requires the package).
- Rewrote `vite.config.ts`:
  - Preserved existing `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
  - Added `yahooProxyPlugin()` implementing the 3-step cookie+crumb handshake, cached in module scope, refreshed on 401/403/429.
  - `undici`'s custom `Agent` with `maxHeaderSize: 128 * 1024` wired in so Yahoo's giant headers don't crash the response.
  - Uses `Headers.getSetCookie()` (array) rather than `.get('set-cookie')` which mangles commas inside `Expires=` dates.
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/options/:symbol` and `GET /api/options/:symbol?date=<unix>` (spec-called-for optional expiration param).
- Created `options-paper` branch off `master`.
- Verified end-to-end: `npm run dev` → `curl http://localhost:3000/api/options/TSLA` returns the full chain JSON (22 expirations, ~194 strikes, matches scratch-prototype numbers).
- `npm test` → 97/97 green.

### Discovered
- The scratch prototype dev server bound to `127.0.0.1` explicitly; the project's default binds to `localhost` (IPv6-preferred on some systems), so early curl against `127.0.0.1` failed. Kept project default — `localhost` works from the browser and that's what matters.
- Pre-existing `tsc --noEmit` errors in `src/engine/paper/__tests__/PaperEngine.test.ts:431,447` (string|number vs string). Exist on `master` before this iteration — NOT introduced by my changes. Spec requires clean typecheck after iterations; will need to address these soon so the gate remains meaningful. Flagging for next iteration.
- `plugin-react` needs to be registered BEFORE the custom middleware plugin in the plugins array — Vite middleware order matters; our proxy path never collides with React HMR so either order works in practice, but putting react first matches convention.
- Undici's `fetch` type signatures don't play perfectly with a thin wrapper that adds `dispatcher`; needed a small `unknown`-based cast to keep TS quiet without `any`.

### Next
Most important next task: **capture a real TSLA chain response as a fixture JSON** (iteration 2). Reason: the adapter, Greeks, and chain-rendering components all need a deterministic test input. Once a fixture exists, the adapter + `OptionChain` parser (iteration 3) can be built and tested offline, and subsequent UI work isn't gated by Yahoo availability. Also worth addressing the pre-existing `PaperEngine.test.ts` tsc errors to restore the clean-typecheck gate.
